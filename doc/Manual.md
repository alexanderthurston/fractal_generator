Hello and Welcome to the Fractals Program User Manual!

Please initialize the program by running the main.py program from your command line:
    You should see a menu like this:
        '''
        Please provide the name of a fractal as an argument

        Mandelbrot Fractals
            fullmandelbrot
            spiral0
            spiral1
            seahorse
            elephants
            leaf

        Julia Fractals
            fulljulia
            hourglass
            lakes
        '''

    Please run main.py again with the addition of the name of the fractal you would like our program to generate.
        ex. "python main.py fullmandelbrot"

    This will generate the selected fractal in a separate window which will save its contents to a .png file upon completion.

    Be cautious, if the window is closed before the drawing is completed it will not save the drawing and will result
        in a program error. If this occurs simply rerun the last command and wait for the drawing to complete.

That's it! Please enjoy the full set of fractal options at your disposal.
